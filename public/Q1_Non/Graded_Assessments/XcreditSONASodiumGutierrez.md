# Take on SONA July 2025 of Pres. Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.
### by sebastian hugo, sodium

## What I found interesting

1. BBM **promised** improvements in agriculture, academics, poverty, healthcare, etc. 
> These were things that other presidents couldn't start to do before the end of their terms, and considering his family tree, I'd say those are some pretty big promises, ergo what is he doing differently?
2. The Anti-Drug Campaign is *still going*.
> Supposedly, there were about **700 government officials** arrested in the war. What are they doing here?
3. He's asking quite a lot of us, quite a lot.

## What I found weird

1. How is he going to actually address *everything* he promised us that he'll do? 
> `I have a small twig telling me that he'll only be able to improve agriculture. but who's to truly say what he'll do.`
2. How much money do we have?
> Because he's putting a lot in really cost-y departments.

## What I'll say

> This SONA sounds like a pretty big promise speech, but I'll have to watch his past SONAs to see if he actually did something during the first half of his term.
> It took him (i think) 2 hrs to mention very diverse problems that are all solved in different ways.
> I know he wants to sound grand, but it's a lot of very deep and serious problems that he promises to fix.
> And he's going throw billions into these programs.

> This subject is *very* controversial, with people either agreeing with BBM or harassing everyone and everything associated with him.
> I like that he wishes to help us in any way possible, so a part of me prays that he does something good. 
> But then again, it's been a while (`about 6-7 presidents ago`) since we got something good from this god-forsaken system, so I have my doubts. 
> I'll side with his words, but I'll stay wary of his image.

## one-off send-off

### **I'll trust his words, but I'll judge of his image until he proves me wrong**
