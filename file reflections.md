# CS Topics I Know Well / Stuff I'm Good At

## 1. Markdown
> Markdown is a collection of different formatting options to make your documents more presentable. It's a very simple and understandable thing, and you don't even have to use all of the options.

## 2. Variable Declaration
> The basic variable declarations are used to define the value of a thing. They're also very simple, intuitive and are some are very flexible, being able to be changed at any point.

## 3. JS Operations
> Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical, Assignment and Ternary Operators are used to assign conditions and values to previously given variables to fit a statement or output's requirements to be printed. They were taught all the way back in G8 and are very intuitive.

## 4. JS Syntax
> Syntax is just the way the code is structured in order to function. The JS syntax is less confining than C++ and is way more understandable.

## 5. Control Statements
> These are loops that work under a condition in order to print a desired output. These were also taught in G8 and are also intuitive.

# CS Topics I Don't Know Well / Stuff I'm Bad At

## 1. Functions
> These are the other functions I didn't mention beforehand. I've had problems with making functions working since G8.

## 2. Loops
> These are the other type of loops I haven't mentioned before. My logic oftentimes doesn't match up with how the program works, and I've had this problem since G8 too.

## 3. Buttons
> For some reason, my buttons just don't work, even though they look like they should. This is actually also partially tied to my problem with functions.

## 4. I/O Statements
> These are lengthy and complex statements I can't get myself to remember and put into my muscle memory. Plus, if one thing is wrong, everything falls, and because of the length of the statements, it'll take a while before I find the problem.

## 5. Processing Function Output
> This is also tied to my problem with functions. In fact, this is my main problem with functions, with the statements inside the function not working how I expected it to.
